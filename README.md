# Explainable-AI-for-Mitotic-Cell-Detection
---

Explainability is a highly desired for AI system to be trusted in the medical field by doctors as well as patients. Our web application is designed to aid doctors and medical practitioners in the diagnosis of cancerous tissues from whole slide images.

The App is designed to process whole slide images. It provides the following features:

---

### - Map of all mitotic detection on the Whole Slide image

For this task we segment the original WSI into smaller sized (320 X 320 pixels) patches. We use YOLOV7 for detecting mitotic cells in these small patches. We used the canine breast cancer dataset to train the model.
